I tried making a template for a store website.

It is hosted on Render.com

Frontend: React.js with MaterialUI framework.
Backend: MongoDB
Images hosted on Imgur.com

It can be viewed at:
https://mern-project-4gsn.onrender.com/
(Since it is deployed on free-tier, it will take about 2 to 3 minutes to load).
